description: >
  StringTie is a fast and highly efficient assembler of RNA-Seq alignments into potential transcripts.
  It also features a 'merge' mode to make a consensus transcriptome from multiple input,
  which can be used with this wrapper.
author:
  - Michael Jahn
input:
  - gff: GFF or GTF files to be merged.
  - reference: GFF or GTF file acting as reference transcriptome (optional).
output:
  - gff: The merged transcriptome in GFF/GTF format.
params:
  - by_strand: >
      Stringtie merge's default is to disregard strand information
      when merging features. Change to 'True' in order to run merging operation
      on each strand separately, then combine the result.
  - extra: additional program arguments.
notes: |
  * The `extra` param allows for additional program arguments.
  * For example, the '-g' option can be used to control the distance at which two adjoining features are merged (default: 50)
